## Year 2020

### Library project (Book catalog)

This week is mainly dedicated to working on a small Django project which is a library store that gives the user information about the author of a given book using the Dewey system to classify publications.
In the process of coding this project, I have applied/learned the following concepts:

#### First week

- Designed the library database using UML models
- Converted the UML models into python models `models.py`
- Used `python makemigrations` & `python migrate` to migrate these models
- Learned how to use Django admin to manage the SQLite database (CRUD operations)
- Used `__str__` inside models to return a human-readable representation of some fields.
- Used `Model.clean()` method to perform custom model validations
